msgstr "This app is made by passionate highline freestyle athletes that want to see the sport grow. As more and more tricks are created every week it is hard to keep the overview. Here we want to show you the most common tricks/combos along with important information to help you learn them. Setting the stick frequency on your tricks/combos allows you to have a visual overview of your arsenal. The feature that was the initial motivation for making this app is the random combo generator. It should help you trying out new combos that you otherwise wouldn't have tried. We want both beginners and advanced athletes to benefit from using this app."
